Write a PHP script which takes a string as argument.

The PHP script should process the provided string as the instructions of a path through a 5 x 5 matrix from the top left corner of the matrix to the bottom right corner of the matrix.
The instructions can be:
- R (right)
- L (left)
- U (up)
- D (down)
- ?

The output of the script should be the same string as the input, but with the question marks replaced by the correct instructions.
So the purpose of the script is to figure out which instructions need to be in the places of the question marks.
Final rule of the puzzle: every cell in the matrix can only be passed through once.

Examples:
- input: ‘R?D?DRDD’, expected output: 'RRDRDRDD'.
- input: ‘RRRRDDDL??', expected output: 'RRRRDDDLDR'.
- input: ‘RRDLDLD?RUR?RD', expected output: ‘RRDLDLDDRURRRD’.



development

 - git checkout -b feature/matrix-puzzle
 - do your code
 - push your work in feature/matrix-puzzle
 - you can create PR/MR agains development branch.

 - Once it is reviewed and merged into development branch,
 - then we will create another PR/MR of development branch against master branch
 - merge into master
 - final release
